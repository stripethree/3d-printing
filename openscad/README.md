_90-degree-l_

A 90 degree PETG pipe to replace a broken part on my Mazdaspeed Miata. The short side connects via a rubber hose to the recirculating Turbosmart bypass valve. The long side goes into another hose which travels to the compressor inlet pipe as part of the [Flyin Miata Intake Kit](https://www.flyinmiata.com/mazdaspeed-complete-intake.html).
